        <p>Hi, my name is Jodiline Rodrigues and I'm from Cape Verde, a small archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, off the West Coast of Africa.
            At the moment, I live in Portugal, which has now become a second home for me, with my husband.
            I love being with my family and creating good memories with them. Dancing, cooking and serving other people, is what makes me very happy, especially when the days are grayer.
            I am learning how to be a developer and it has been a truly enriching and challenging experience. I'm loving the challenge!</p>
